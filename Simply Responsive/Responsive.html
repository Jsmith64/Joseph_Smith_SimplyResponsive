    <h1>@media queries</h1>
    <p>CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about 
        the device being used to access the website. For 
        example, it can be used to detect the size of the 
        device, its capabilities, and its orientation. For 
        this course, we will be using it to detect the device 
        size, but keep in mind that it is capable of much 
        more.</p>
